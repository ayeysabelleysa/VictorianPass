# Archive of Unused / Legacy Files

This folder contains files that are not referenced by the active application flows, or are legacy prototypes kept for reference. Moving them here helps reduce noise and clarifies which files are currently in use.

Notes:
- `status_view.php` fallback was updated to navigate to `checkurstatus.php`, so `status.html` can be archived safely.
- Draft prototype pages and their dedicated assets/styles were moved here.
- Server-side scripts with no references (e.g., legacy upload handlers, one-time seeders) were archived to avoid confusion.

If you need to restore any file, move it back to the project root or its original path and update any links as appropriate.

List will stay in sync with periodic audits.
